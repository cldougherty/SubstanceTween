# SubstanceTween
What does this tool do?
This tool takes exposed parameters from substance designer files(SBAR) and allows you to create multiple key frames by manipulating the exposed Variables, creating transitions and animating them.
You can Write variables to XML files and read from them as well.
When you are done creating your animated object you can save the object as a Prefab for future use.
